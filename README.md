# Portfolio Site

This is my first Flask project where I’m building a personal portfolio website.

## About

The site is a work in progress. It will showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as I grow as a developer.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13  
- Flask  
- HTML/CSS (to be added)  
- Git & GitHub for version control

## How to Run

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The website will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Status

Under development — more features and pages coming soon!
